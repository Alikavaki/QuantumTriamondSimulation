# QuantumTriamondSimulation
This project provides Python-based lattice quantum simulations. It includes classes to model quantum lattice systems, generate physical states (following Gauss's law), and compute the Hamiltonian matrix. The States and Hamiltonian classes currently handle one row of unit cells.
